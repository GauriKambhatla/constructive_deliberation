"I cant believe that they just didn't add 1 word and they would of gotten tons of support How about "" Black Lives Matter TOO! ""","Adding ""too"" implies all and would make a lot more sense.

However, it's important to understand the message behind the existing slogan.","Thank you for your suggestion. Adding ""too"" could indeed suggest more inclusion. However, ""BLM"" on its own may communicate a specific message.","I see where you're coming from, the inclusion of ""too"" in ""Black Lives Matter too"" could indeed create more support and imply equality.

We are now living in a republican run country, look around.","Weird, I don't see any republicans doing this. 100% of looters are democrats. The party of morals ey?","It's interesting, I haven't spotted any republicans participating in this. It seems like the majority of looters might be democrats. It's a different take on the party of morals, isn't it?","It's valid to link the current chaos to the change in political leadership. However, it's noteworthy that looting and unrest can't be exclusively attributed to one political group.","So you believe that during a democrat's rule there is less chaos than a republican's, as seen now. However, it seems you suggest all the looters are democrats, not republicans. Correct?","I also recognize the change in leadership, but I don’t believe that 100% of looters are democrats. Let's not generalize based on party lines.","Thank you for your comment, but I would like to note that not all looters are democrats as you suggest. It's not quite accurate to assign such actions to any single political party.","I see your point about the differences between political eras, but it might not be entirely fair to say all looters are Democrats. The situation seems more complex than party affiliation.","Strange, I haven't noticed any republicans causing this. It seems all the individuals causing this chaos are democrats. Quite a moral party, isn't it?","Interesting perspective. However, attributing behaviors strictly to political affiliation oversimplifies the issue. It's important to consider the broader context of these actions."

It's just a natural occurrence...","While the climate naturally fluctuates, human activities intensify its changes, similar to how smoking can increase the risk of lung cancer."
