"I cant believe that they just didn't add 1 word and they would of gotten tons of support How about "" Black Lives Matter TOO! ""","Adding ""too"" implies all and would make a lot more sense.

"We had a democrat run country for 8 years and didnt see this kind of chaos. We are now living in a republican run country, look around.","Weird, I don't see any republicans doing this. 100% of looters are democrats. The party of morals ey?","It's interesting, I haven't spotted any republicans participating in this. It seems like the majority of looters might be democrats. It's a different take on the party of morals, isn't it?","It's valid to link the current chaos to the change in political leadership.

However, it seems you suggest all the looters are democrats, not republicans. Correct?","I also recognize the change in leadership, but I donâ€™t believe that 100% of looters are democrats. Let's not generalize based on party lines.","Thank you for your comment, but I would like to note that not all looters are democrats as you suggest. It's not quite accurate to assign such actions to any single political party.","I see your point about the differences between political eras, but it might not be entirely fair to say all looters are Democrats. The situation seems more complex than party affiliation.","Strange, I haven't noticed any republicans causing this. It seems all the individuals causing this chaos are democrats. Quite a moral party, isn't it?","Interesting perspective. However, attributing behaviors strictly to political affiliation oversimplifies the issue. It's important to consider the broader context of these actions."
