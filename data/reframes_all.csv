The party of morals ey?","It's interesting, I haven't spotted any republicans participating in this. It seems like the majority of looters might be democrats.

Let's not generalize based on party lines.","Thank you for your comment, but I would like to note that not all looters are democrats as you suggest. It's not quite accurate to assign such actions to any single political party.","I see your point about the differences between political eras, but it might not be entirely fair to say all looters are Democrats. The situation seems more complex than party affiliation.","Strange, I haven't noticed any republicans causing this. It seems all the individuals causing this chaos are democrats. Quite a moral party, isn't it?","Interesting perspective. However, attributing behaviors strictly to political affiliation oversimplifies the issue. It's important to consider the broader context of these actions."

But, as the executive, his orders do carry weight.","Thank you for your insight. Indeed, Trump executed the order and the military followed, so it wasn't a full government sanction. Those seeking a reason can certainly consider this action.","You're correct in emphasizing Trump's role, as he's the executive and the military acted on his orders. While not entirely government-sanctioned, this action indeed provides an excuse for those seeking one.","The military acted on Trump's command, not a complete government approval. Critics found their reason in this action.","True, it primarily reflects Trump's decision, emphasizing the executive's role. An isolated action, though it might serve as justification for those seeking reasons."

However, cops' political leanings are not straightforward since Republicans are generally not pro-union, including public-sector unions.","So, you’re suggesting you thought cops leaned Republican, but recent events have shown that's not entirely accurate.

However, assuming all protestors have useless degrees or are in debt minimizes the broader concerns they are raising.",Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I see your point but I believe not everyone is insincere in their activism. Their educational background or debt doesn’t invalidate their concerns.,"I agree that some protesters may not genuinely care about the issues they claim to.
